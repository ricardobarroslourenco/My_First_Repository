\section*{Data in Brief Article Template}
%% main text
\noindent \href{https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief/about-data-in-brief/data-in-brief-faq}%
{\textit{Data in Brief}} 
is an open access journal that publishes data articles.
Please note:
\begin{itemize}
\item A data article is different to a research article, so it is
important to \textbf{use the template} below to prepare your manuscript for Data
in Brief.
\item A data article should \textbf{simply describe data} without providing
conclusions or interpretive insights.
\item Before you start writing your data article you should read the
guidance on 
\href{https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief/policies-and-guidelines/what-data-are-suitable-for-data-in-brief}%
{What Data are Suitable for Data in Brief}.
\item It is mandatory that Data in Brief authors share their research data:
\begin{itemize}
\item If you have \textbf{raw data} (also referred to as primary, source or
unprocessed data) relating to any charts, graphs or figures in the
manuscript, these data must be publicly available, either with the data
article (e.g. as a supplementary file) or hosted on a trusted data
repository.

\item If you are describing \textbf{secondary data} you are required to provide
a list of the primary data sources used \underline{and} to make the full secondary
dataset publicly available, either with the data article (e.g. as a
supplementary file) or hosted on a trusted data repository.

\item Although we allow supplementary files, it is preferred that
authors deposit their data in a trusted data repository ($>$70\% of
Data in Brief authors now do this). See our�
\href{https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-resources/research-data/data-base-linking#repositories}%
{list of supported data repositories}.

\item For data that, for ethical reasons, require access controls a
mechanism must be provided so that our Editors and reviewers may access
these data without revealing their identities to authors (more
information is provided in the template \hyperlink{target1}{below}).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Have you any questions? See a list of frequently asked questions 
\href{https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief/about-data-in-brief/data-in-brief-faq}{here},
or email our Managing Editors:  
\href{mailto:dib-me@elsevier.com}{dib-me@elsevier.com}. This
step-by-step�
\href{https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief/about-data-in-brief/how-to-submit-your-research-data-article-data-in-brief}%
{video}�guide will also tell you how to complete the
template correctly to maximise your chances of acceptance.

\vskip6pt
\noindent Authors can submit to Data in Brief in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[\bf(1)] \textbf{If you are submitting your data article directly to Data in
Brief, you can now skip the next section and complete the} 
\hyperlink{target2}{\textbf{Data Article template}}.

\item[\bf(2)] \textbf{If you are submitting your data article to Data in Brief via
another Elsevier journal as a co-submission (i.e. with a Research
Article), please read the} \hyperlink{target3}{\textbf{Co-submission Instructions}}
\textbf{on the next page
before completing the} \hyperlink{target2}{\textbf{Data Article template}}.

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{target3}{}
\section*{Co-submission Instructions}
A co-submission to~\textit{Data in Brief}~is done at the same time that you
submit (or resubmit, after revision) a research article to another
Elsevier journal. For co-submissions you therefore submit your 
\textit{Data in Brief} data article manuscript via the other journal's 
submission system and \underline{not} directly to 
\textit{Data in Brief} itself. 

\vskip6pt\noindent
The other Elsevier journal's Guide for Authors will state if a
co-submission is offered by that journal, and any revision letter/email
you receive from a participating journal will contain an offer to
submit a data article to \textit{Data in Brief}.

\vskip6pt\noindent
\textbf{To complete a co-submission you will need to zip your
~\textit{Data in Brief}~
manuscript file and all other files relevant to the 
~\textit{Data in Brief}~
submission (including any supplementary data files) into a single .zip
file, and upload this as a "Data in Brief"-labelled item in the other
journal's submission system when you submit manuscript to that journal.
The .zip file will then be automatically transferred to 
~\textit{Data in Brief}~
when your research article is accepted for publication in the other
journal, and when published your original research article and data
article will link to each other on ScienceDirect.}

\vskip6pt\noindent
\textbf{As~\textit{Data in Brief}~is open access, a moderate article publication charge
(APC) fee is payable on publication. For more information about the
APC, please see 
\href{https://www.elsevier.com/journals/data-in-brief/2352-3409/open-access-journal}%
{here}.}

\vskip6pt\noindent
\textit{Data in Brief} \underline{requires} that authors share their research data. This can
be done by submitting it with the data article (e.g. as a supplementary
file) or by hosting on a trusted data repository (the latter is
preferred). Failure to do this will delay publication of your
co-submission.

\vskip6pt\noindent
\textbf{If you have any questions, please contact: 
\href{mailto:DIB@Elsevier.com}{DIB@Elsevier.com}}

\vskip6pt\noindent
Please note, authors should not republish the same data presented in
their original research article in a \textit{Data in Brief} co-submission, as
this could constitute duplicate publication; however, \textit{Data in Brief}
welcomes the publication of any data article that fulfils one or more
of the following criteria:

\checkmark A description of the supplementary data that would
previously have been hosted as supplementary electronic files alongside
your original research article.*

\checkmark A description of the full dataset or additional information
that will aid reuse of the data.

\checkmark A detailed description of the raw data relating to the
charts, graphs or figures in your companion research article, if making
these data available will substantially enhance reproducibility and/or
reanalysis of the data.

\checkmark Any negative datasets or data from intermediate experiments
related to your research. 

\textsf{X} Review articles or supplemental files from a review article
are not considered original data and are typically unsuitable for Data
in Brief. 

\vskip12pt\noindent
* If describing supplementary data that you previously planned to
publish as supplem
entary electronic files hosted alongside the original
research article, it is requested that you either\break 
deposit these in a
repository (preferred) or submit these to \textit{Data in Brief} alongside the
data article. \textbf{They should not be published as supplementary files with
your research article in the other journal}.

\section*{Data Description}

\noindent [Individually describe each data file (i.e. figure 1, figure 2, table
1, dataset, raw data, supplementary data, etc.) that are included in
this article. Please make sure you refer to every data file and provide
a clear description for each - do not simply list them. No insight,
interpretation, background or conclusions should be included in this
section. Please include legends with any tables, figures or graphs.

\noindent\textbf{Tip:} do not forget to describe any supplementary data files.]

\section*{Experimental Design, Materials and Methods}

\noindent [Offer a complete description of the experimental design and methods
used to acquire these data. Please provide any programs or code files
used for filtering and analyzing these data. It is very important that
this section is as comprehensive as possible. If you are submitting via
another Elsevier journal (a co-submission) you are encouraged to
provide more detail than in your accompanying research article. There
is no character limit for this section; however, no insight,
interpretation, or background should be included in this section.

\noindent\textbf{Tip:} do not describe your data (figures, tables, etc.) in this section,
do this in the Data Description section above.]  

\section*{Ethics Statement}
